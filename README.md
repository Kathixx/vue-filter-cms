### VueJS Filter CMS

##### The main goal of this project was to create a CMS to filter any kind of entries without a database. 
##### Logic and fontend are implemented with VueJS and Axios for the AJAX-Requests. Information are stored  in the data.js, which is a JSON with entries and filters. 
##### Login credentials are encryption with SHA3-512  and the backend of the CMS is only accessible with a session created by entering the right username and password combination.

##### It's customizable and of course open to use for private and commercial use.
